    <p>The pressure to delivery ever faster in software development has made companies seeking expertise in agile methodologies to develop their projects. However, it is hard for companies to migrate from their current methodologies for agile methods. This difficulty often means that companies to choose to continue with their existing processes even if they are not more efficient for the execution of projects.

    This study is an exploratory research with the objective of documenting as patterns recurring actions in deploying agile, successfully used in many contexts. Data were collected through interviews and case studies. These patterns can serve as a guide for companies wishing to deploy agile.

    After the implementation of agile methods, software projects tend to be delivered in less time, with more quality and more aligned with customer expectations.</p>
