    <p> I'm a developer who loves crafting things for the web and arduino. I also love coffee, classic rock, photography and good food. I know the difference between Star Wars and Star Trek, and I think the answer to life, the universe, and everything is 42.</p>

    <p>On the front end side, I enjoy crafting beautiful and clean code using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript with heavy dose of automation. On the back end side, most often I work with PHP, but also love playing with Node.js and Ruby.</p>

    <p>I used to work as a front end developer for advertising agencies and I currently work on developing products at <a href="https://www.rocket-internet.com/">Rocket Internet</a>. Here, I do front and back development for <a href="https://www.tripda.com">Tripda</a> (one of the ventures of Rocket Internet).</p>

    <p>I’m a speaker at local front end, Angular.js, and Node.js meetups, and I also presented a session at <a href="http://www.thedevelopersconference.com.br" target="_blank">TDC (The Developers Conference)</a>.</p>
