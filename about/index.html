    <p>Hi, my name is Suelen and yes, I am a women in tech.</p>

    <p>I am a very persistent, self-motivated and very creative person! I like to run, biking and watch good movies, no dramas neither horror.</p>

    <p>I discovered software development when I was fifteen years old in my technical course in Data Processing. After that I realize that it is what I want for my life.</p>

    <p>My first programming language was Visual Basic 6. Yeh, I know, it is so old! Depends on how old you are, you will agree or not ;). But, for me it is so old. </p>

    <p>Few time later, I started work with others languages like VB and C# .Net and Java. But my life was more than backend. Sometimes I had to work with frontend techs too like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and so on. Today frontend development is very more cool than it was when I started.</p>

    <p>Today my main study focus is on mobile, specifically, Android development. But I continue update myself about backend and frontend technologies because I need it to do all things in my personal projects and, well, I like it!</p>
