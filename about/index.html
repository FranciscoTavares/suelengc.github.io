    <p>Hi, my name is Suelen and yes, I am a women in tech. I discovered software development 12 years ago when I started my technical couse in Data Processing. After that I realize that it is what I want for my life.</p>

    <p>My first language was Visual Basic 6, yes, so old! Depends on how old you are, you will agree or not ;). But, for me it is so old. Few time latter, I started work with others more cool languages like VB.Net, C#.Net and Java. But my life was more than backend. Sometimes I had to work with front end techs too like HTML, CSS, JavaScript and so on. Today front end development is very more cool than it is when I start.</p>

    <p>Today I study a lot of Android development but, maitain myself up to date with back end and front end technologies because I need to do all things in my personal projects and, well, I like it!</p>
