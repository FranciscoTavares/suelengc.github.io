    <p> I'm a developer who loves crafting things for the web, arduino, coffee, classic rock, photography and good food. I know the difference between Star Wars and Star Trek and I think the answer to life the universe and everything is 42.</p>

    <p>On front-end side crafting a beautiful and clean code in HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript with heavy dose of automation. On backend side most often working with PHP, but also loves playing with Node.js and Ruby.</p>

    <p>I used to work as a front-end developer with past experience in advertising agencies and currently working on developing products at <a href="https://www.rocket-internet.com/">Rocket Internet</a> where I hack on both ends in <a href="https://www.tripda.com">Tripda</a>. Speaker at local front-end, Angular.js and Node.js meetups and <a href="http://www.thedevelopersconference.com.br" target="_blank">TDC</a>.</p>
