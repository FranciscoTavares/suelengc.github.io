    <p>Hi, my name is Suelen and yes, I am a women in tech.</p>

    <p>I am a full stack developer with a passion for Android development. All my career I acted with web and mobile software development.</p>

    <p>About web development I went through various backend technologies like Java and C# and frontend as HTML, CSS, Javascript, JQuery, Angular and others. In the backend I have worked in companies using their own infrastructure and others that used a cloud service like AWS or Google Cloud.</p>

    <p>On mobile development, in the last 5 years I've been specializing me in Android development. It's something I like a lot and I just extrapolating a bit beyond the knowledge just about development for also about usability (UX) and interfaces (UI).</p>

    <p>I am a very persistent person, self-motivated and very creative! I like to run, rollerblading, listen happy musics, watch good movies, no dramas neither horror.</p>
